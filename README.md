# 🧬 bio-to-ai

Welcome! This project explores how **biology** meets **artificial intelligence** 🤖. From decoding DNA with machine learning to predicting protein folding and using AI to fight disease — this is your launchpad!

## 🌱 Topics
- DNA 🧬 and Gene Expression
- Proteins and Protein Folding 🧪
- Cell Behavior and AI Modeling 🧫
- AI-Powered Disease Prediction 💉
- Bioinformatics Tools
- Generative AI for Drug Discovery 💊

## 🚀 Goals
- Build AI models that learn from biological data
- Learn and apply bioinformatics + deep learning
- Publish cool experiments and visualizations
- Inspire other students with hands-on biology + AI!

## 📁 Structure
- `datasets/`: Contains biological sample data
- `notebooks/`: Colab or Jupyter notebooks
- `models/`: Trained models (ML/DL)
- `docs/`: Theory and research insights

## 💡 Roadmap
- [ ] Stage 1: Collect DNA + protein datasets
- [ ] Stage 2: Build simple ML models
- [ ] Stage 3: Visualize with matplotlib/seaborn
- [ ] Stage 4: Apply deep learning to classify genes/diseases
- [ ] Stage 5: Publish and share on GitHub & Notion
