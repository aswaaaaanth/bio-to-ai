# DNA Pattern Analyzer with AI

This project detects biological patterns in DNA sequences using AI concepts like sequence modeling and classification.

## 🔬 Goal
Convert biological DNA sequence data into vector form, detect common patterns (motifs), and classify sequences.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Raw DNA samples.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory notebooks.
- `models/`: AI logic for pattern classification.
